Ron just found his own copy of advanced potion making, but its been corrupted by some kind of spell. Help him recover it!

1st. My standard approach for this is identifying what file is it and using binwalk.
    //After knowing that it is a Zlib, i run hexdump and found certain details that's why I use hexdump
    //I noticed that it has PB IHDR on the top, i searched it on google and highlights it as
    //"A valid PNG image must contain an IHDR chunk", In my mind, maybe this is an PNG file. So i open another PNG file and it is quite similar

2nd. I changed the hex values the same as the standard PNG file
    
    89 50 42 11 0D 0A 1A 0A 00 12 13 14 49 48 44 52 -> advance-motion-making file
    89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A 00 00 00 0D 49 48 44 52 -> PNG file

3rd. After changing the hex values, I inputted manually the PNG file extension to advance-motion-making.png
    //And it appears to be an image, a full red, maybe the flag is inside the image.
    //I use stegsolve for this.
        $ java -jar stegsolve.jar\~
    //After importing the file to the stegsolve app, I found the flag on Red plane 0

The flag is: picoCTF{w1z4rdry}
