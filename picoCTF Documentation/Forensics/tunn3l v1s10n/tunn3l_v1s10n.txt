We found this file. Recover the flag.

Hints: Weird that it won't display right...

1st. This is quite tricky since it is a file alone. I open it in a hex editor HxD and notices that the header is BM.
So I assume that it is a BMP file and it is. Upon opening the file, I noticed that the header is wrong by indication.

Offset (h) 
00000000 0A 0B 0E 0F
00000010 BA D0 BA D0

I assume that it is literally bad, so I reference another BMP Image and change those values as

Offset (h) 
00000000 0A 0B 0E 0F
00000010 36 00 28 00

And it works, kind of. I want to know what controls the height and weight of the image inside the bitmap source code.
So I use exiftool to know the meta information of the bmp tool

$ exiftool tunn3l_v1s10n.bmp

I noticed that the width is 1134 and the height is 306 but it is not in hex. In order to convert that values, I will use Python.

$ python 
>> hex(1134)
'0x46e'
>> hex(850)
'0x352'

Offset (h) 
00000010 6E 04
00000020 52 03

The way it is read is in reverse, as you can see on the offset it is 6E04 and on conversion it is 46e same on the height.
After saving, I checked the image and the flag is displayed! 

The flag is: picoCTF{qu1t3_a_v13w_2020}
