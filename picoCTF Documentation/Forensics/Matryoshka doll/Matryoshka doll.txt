1st. Matryoshka dolls are a set of wooden dolls of decreasing size placed one inside another. What's the final one?

In my perspective before solving this, Matryoshka dolls are dolls that have dolls inside. And the file is an image, I think this is Steganography.

2nd. I assume that it has a file inside a file, so I use binwalk to find out what are inside the photo.

$ binwalk -e dolls.jpg

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             PNG image, 594 x 1104, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
3226          0xC9A           TIFF image data, big-endian, offset of first image directory: 8
272492        0x4286C         Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: 378954, uncompressed size: 383938, name: base_images/2_c.jpg

3rd. My assumption is true. After using binwalk, there is a folder extracted with a picture of another Matryoshka doll and a zip with the same doll.

I will repeat to run binwalk until flag is located.

$ binwalk -e 2_c.jpg

3rd. At the fourth extraction, flag is located but the output is this p�i�c�o�C�T�F�{�b�f�6�a�c�f�8�7�8�d�c�b�d�7�5�2�f�4�7�2�1�e�4�1�b�1�b�1�b�6�6�b�}
I can manually eyeball it and extract one by one but by using cat, it prints the content of a file onto a standard output.

$ cat flag.txt

The flag is: picoCTF{bf6acf878dcbd752f4721e41b1b1b66b}
