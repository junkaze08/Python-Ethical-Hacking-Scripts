Revisit the last transmission. We think this transmission contains a hidden message. There are also some clues clue 1, clue 2, clue 3.

Hints:
    Use the clues to extract the another flag from the .wav file

1st. Revisit the first m00nwalk on how I convert .wav file to a png file using QSSTV.
    //Convert the clue1.wav clue2.wav2 clue3.wav
    Results:
        clue1 = Password
                hidden_stegosaurus
        clue2 = The quieter you are
                the more you can
                    HEAR
        clue3 = Alan Eliasen the Future Boy

2nd. I thought that this is an Image Steganography but I use hexdump and HxC, there is no irregularities.
    //When I searched on Google who is Alan Eliasen, he is a programmer and have Steganography documentation.
    //Right below ther is steghide, It is a steganography program that is able to hide data in various kinds of image and audio-files.
    //Now I wonder the clue1 is stegosaurus is associated with steghide so I run steghide on every clues but it doesn't have any signs of the flag.
    $ sudo apt-get install steghide

3rd. By trying to use steghide on the message.wav, there is a .txt file and when I open the .txt file, there is the flag, hiding in plain sight.
    steghide extract -f -p "hidden_stegosaurus" -sf message.wav           
    wrote extracted data to "steganopayload12154.txt".

The flag is: picoCTF{the_answer_lies_hidden_in_plain_sight}
