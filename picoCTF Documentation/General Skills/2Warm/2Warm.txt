Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

Hints: Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if your answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.

1st. Base 10 is decimal and converting it to Base 2 which is binary is easy by using bin() function in python
    python
    >>> bin(42)
    '0b101010'

2nd. We will extract the proper syntax for the flag
    The flag is: picoCTF{101010}
