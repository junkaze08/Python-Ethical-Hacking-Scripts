Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

Hints: grep tutorial

1st. I approached this manually using grep 'pico' specifying the string
    $ grep 'pico' file                                 
    picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}

The flag is: picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}
