Using netcat (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org at port 41120 to get the flag?

Hints: nc tutorial

1st. Since I am using netcat, this is how my approach is.
    I ping the jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org because I need the IP Address
    
    $ ping jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org       
    PING jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org (3.131.60.8) 56(84) bytes of data.

2nd. Now that I know the IP Address, i can run the nc command with the IP address and the port
    
    $ nc -v 3.131.60.8 41120
    ec2-3-131-60-8.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com [3.131.60.8] 41120 (?) open
    You're on your way to becoming the net cat master
    picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_3214be47}

Horray! the flag is found! But it can also be achieve without knowing the IP Address

    $ nc -v jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 41120
    DNS fwd/rev mismatch: jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org != ec2-3-131-60-8.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
    jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org [3.131.60.8] 41120 (?) open
    You're on your way to becoming the net cat master
    picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_3214be47}

The flag is: picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_3214be47}
