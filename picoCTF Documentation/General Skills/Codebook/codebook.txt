Run the Python script code.py in the same directory as codebook.txt.

Hints: 
    On the webshell, use ls to see if both files are in the directory you are in
    The str_xor function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.

1st. I make sure that the code.py and codebook.txt is on the same directory and run the python file. And displays the flag!
    $ python3 code.py                       
    picoCTF{c0d3b00k_455157_197a982c}

The flag is: picoCTF{c0d3b00k_455157_197a982c}
