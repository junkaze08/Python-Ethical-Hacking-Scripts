I have these 2 images, can you make a flag out of them? scrambled1.png scrambled2.png

Hints:

    Think of different ways you can "stack" images

1st. I approach this using stegsolve. First I downloaded stegsolve and set as execution allowing it to run as a program.
    
    $ wget http://www.caesum.com/handbook/Stegsolve.jar -O stegsolve.jar
    $ chmod +x stegsolve.jar
    $ mkdir bin
    $ mv stegsolve.jar bin/

2nd. After installing, I run the program and import the scrambled photo (either of the two photo, it doesn't matter what to import first)
    $ java -jar stegsolve.jar\~ 

3rd. When stegsolve is running, click on Open under File and locate the first scrambled photo
    //Click on Image Combiner under Analyse and locate the second scrambled photo
    //Another pane will pop-up and click on the "< >" to pan on different modes of photo extraction
    //It locates on ADD and ADD (R,G,B separate) and the flag is found!

The flag is: picoCTF{d562333d}
